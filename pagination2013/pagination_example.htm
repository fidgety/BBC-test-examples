      <p>
        As I did a similar test during my last BBC interviews I thought I'd try something a little different this time. Please bear in mind that I did set a strict 1.5 hours limit to my coding as advised by Harriet; as a result I would admit to being a little embarrassed about the result. Some notes I made as I went along....
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>TDD without getters and setters; this in hindsight would lend itself to a different kind of 'object'; one with no external visibility.</li>
        <li>The GEL rules suggested a BDD approach may be pertinent - for that reason I used Mocha in BDD mode with Chai for assertions; I haven't used these client side before so this was a perfect opportunity.</li>
        <li>I wanted a solution which was reusable differently structured JSON, the only stipulation is it must be an array of objects. This meant clear separation between pagination and description responsibilities.</li>
        <li>I would have liked to add a message bus to drive the inter component interaction. It would also have been useful for the selectItem method which is too big.</li>
        <li>I would love to have spent another half hour or so refactoring both code and tests to aid readability, but given the choice I would rather have a functioning example to show.</li>
        <li>Sorry about the look and feel - I should really have a template at hand for these things!</li>
        <li>There is so much more I would have liked to have added - but still an enjoyable task - thank you.</li>
      </ul>
